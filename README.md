## Project Overview
This project explores over 2,500 chocolate bar reviews from 2006 to 2021, analyzing ratings, cocoa percentages, bean types, and company trends. The goal is to uncover insights about what drives high-quality chocolate, including popular ingredients, top-performing companies, and flavor profiles.

## Key Insights
- Most chocolate bars are rated between 3.0–4.0.  
- Average ratings have gradually increased from 2006–2021.
